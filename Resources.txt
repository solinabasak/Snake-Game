High quality animation.
The question is most simply answered with. requestAnimationFrame produces higher quality animation completely eliminating flicker
 and shear that can happen when using setTimeout or setInterval, and reduce or completely remove frame skips.

Shear
is when a new canvas buffer is presented to the display buffer midway through the display scan resulting in a shear line caused by
the mismatched animation positions.

Flicker
is caused when the canvas buffer is presented to the display buffer before the canvas has been fully rendered.

Frame skip
is caused when the time between rendering frames is not in precise sync with the display hardware. Every so many frames a frame
will be skipped producing inconsistent animation. (There are method to reduce this but personally I think these methods produce
worse overall results) As most devices use 60 frames per second (or multiple of) resulting in a new frame every 16.666...ms and
the timers setTimeout and setInterval use integers values they can never perfectly match the framerate (rounding up to 17ms if
you have interval = 1000/60)
